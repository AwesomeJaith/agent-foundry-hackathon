# Medivice 🩺🤖

## Overview  
Medivice is an AI-powered patient intake system designed to modernize outdated healthcare workflows. Instead of having doctors or staff repeatedly collect the same basic information from patients, Medivice automates the process through a conversational AI assistant. Patients can provide personal details, symptoms, and reasons for their visit over a phone call, and doctors can instantly review this data in a simple, real-time dashboard.

## 🚩 The Challenge We’re Solving  
The medical industry relies on **legacy systems** and **time-consuming intake processes** that slow down care and add unnecessary administrative overhead. Doctors often spend valuable time gathering preliminary information when they could instead focus on treatment and diagnosis.  

**Our goal:**  
- Save doctors time by automating preliminary data collection  
- Improve the patient intake experience with a conversational AI  
- Provide doctors with a clean, actionable dashboard view of patient issues

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. **Patient Call** → Patients call an AI assistant powered by OpenAI.  
2. **Data Gathering** → The assistant collects intake data such as:  
   - Personal information  
   - Symptoms  
   - Reason for visit  
3. **Data Storage** → Information is stored and made available to the doctor.  
4. **Doctor Dashboard** → Doctors log in to a Next.js dashboard to view:  
   - Patient profiles  
   - Reported symptoms and urgent concerns
